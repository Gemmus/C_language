Student grade calculator
Write a program that calculates and displays the final grades for a student based on their scores in
different subjects. The program should allow the user to input scores for multiple subjects and then
calculate the average grade and overall grade for the student.
  
Requirements:
• The program should start by asking the user for their name.
• Then, it should ask the user how many subjects they want to calculate grades for.
• For each subject, the program should prompt the user to enter the subject name and the
score (as a percentage).
• Calculate the average grade based on the scores and display it.
• Determine and display the overall grade based on the following grading scale:
o 5: 90-100
o 4: 80-89
o 3: 70-79
o 2: 60-69
o 1: 50-59
o 0: Below 50
• The program must also write the same report to a file

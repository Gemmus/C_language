Study planner
Write program to print your daily schedule. The program reads your schedule from a CSV file. The
header row has four headings: Day, Time, Course, Room. Data rows need to appear in any specific
order. Program asks user to choose a day and prints the day’s schedule starting with earliest time in
ascending order. If there are no classes for the day program prints “No classes today”. If user enters
“stop” as a day the program stops.

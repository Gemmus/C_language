Write a program that reads course information from a file. The file is a text file where each line
contains either course name and number of credits in square brackets or student name and grade
separated with a colon. For example:

[Computer architecture:5]
Billie Mandala: 5
Arthur Dent: 3
Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez: 2
[C programming:3]
Olive Nelson: 0
Dilbert Einstein: 5
Arthur Dent: 4

Empty lines are ignored. White space at the beginning or end of the student name or course title is
removed. Names that appear before any course title are ignored and error message is printed.
  
Program asks user to enter students name and then prints a list of courses that the student has taken
with grades and finally the average grade. If user enters “stop” as the name the program stops.
